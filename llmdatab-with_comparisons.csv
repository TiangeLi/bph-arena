What are the symptoms of benign prostatic enlargement?,"BPE can result in a range of symptoms including:

A delay in starting and/or finishing urinating
Having to strain to urinate
A weak stream of urine
Stopping and starting while urinating
Spraying urine while going to the toilet, or the urinary stream splitting
The feeling that you cannot fully empty your bladder
Needing to urinate more often than is normal and/or more urgently
Waking up at night to urinate
Finding it difficult to hold or control your bladder
Accidentally leaking urine (urinary incontinence)
In some men, the symptoms are mild and do not need treatment. In others, they can be troublesome and can benefit from treatment.","When the prostate is enlarged, it can bother or block the bladder. Needing to pass urine often is a common symptom of BPH. This might include the need to pass urine as often as every one to two hours, mainly at night.

Other symptoms of BPH are listed below:
• Incomplete emptying: the feeling your bladder is full, even after passing urine.
• Frequency: the need to pass urine often, about every one to two hours.
• Intermittency: the need to stop and start several times when passing urine.
• Urgency: feeling the urgent need to pass urine as if you can’t wait.
• Weak stream: a weak urine flow.
• Straining: trouble starting to pass urine or the need to push or strain to pass urine.
• Nocturia: the need to wake up at night more than two times to pass urine.","Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), typically presents with various urinary symptoms due to the increased size of the prostate gland compressing the urethra. The common symptoms include:

1. **Frequent Urination**: An increased need to urinate, especially at night (nocturia).
2. **Urgency**: A sudden, strong need to urinate.
3. **Difficulty Starting Urination**: Hesitancy or straining to begin urination.
4. **Weak Urine Stream**: A weak or interrupted urine flow.
5. **Incomplete Bladder Emptying**: Feeling that the bladder is not completely empty after urinating.
6. **Dribbling at the End of Urination**: Leakage of urine after finishing.
7. **Painful Urination**: Discomfort or pain during urination (less common).
8. **Urinary Retention**: Inability to urinate, which can be a medical emergency.

These symptoms are collectively known as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and management plan.","The symptoms of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), as outlined in the provided guidelines, include a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that are categorized into storage, voiding, and post-micturition symptoms. These symptoms can significantly impact the quality of life of affected individuals. 

### Storage Symptoms:
- **Increased frequency**: Needing to urinate more often than usual.
- **Urgency**: A sudden, strong need to urinate.
- **Nocturia**: Waking up at night to urinate.

### Voiding Symptoms:
- **Slow stream**: A weak or interrupted urinary stream.
- **Hesitancy**: Difficulty starting urination.
- **Straining**: The need to strain or push to start and maintain urination.
- **Incomplete emptying**: Feeling that the bladder is not completely empty after urination.

### Post-Micturition Symptoms:
- **Dribbling**: Leakage of urine after finishing urination.
- **Residual urine sensation**: A feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.

These symptoms are collectively referred to as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and are commonly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is the histological term for the enlargement of the prostate gland that can lead to BPE and benign prostatic obstruction (BPO)【9:0†AUA Guidelines.pdf】【9:1†AUA Guidelines.pdf】【9:7†AUA Guidelines.pdf】【9:9†AUA Guidelines.pdf】【9:16†AUA Guidelines.pdf】.","Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) can cause various symptoms, often related to how the prostate affects the bladder and urinary system. Here are the common symptoms:

### Storage Symptoms
- **Frequent urination:** Needing to urinate more often than usual, especially at night (nocturia).
- **Urgency:** A sudden, strong need to urinate immediately.
- **Incontinence:** Involuntary leakage of urine.

### Voiding Symptoms
- **Weak urine stream:** A noticeable decrease in the strength of the urine flow.
- **Hesitancy:** Difficulty starting the flow of urine.
- **Intermittency:** The urine flow stops and starts during urination.
- **Straining:** Needing to push or strain to begin urination.

### Post-Micturition Symptoms
- **Dribbling:** A slow, dripping flow of urine after the main stream has finished.
- **Incomplete emptying:** Feeling that the bladder is not completely empty after urination.

These symptoms can vary in severity and may affect quality of life. It's important to note that not all men with an enlarged prostate will experience these symptoms. If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and management."
What are the risks of benign prostatic enlargement? ,"BPE is not cancer. In some cases, it can lead to serious complications such as kidney disease or the inability to urinate. You should always contact your doctor if you have any difficulty urinating.",No information available,"Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), primarily affects older men and can lead to several risks and complications if left untreated. These include:

1. **Urinary Retention**: The enlarged prostate can obstruct the urethra, leading to acute urinary retention, which is a sudden and painful inability to urinate.

2. **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**: Incomplete bladder emptying increases the risk of infections in the urinary tract.

3. **Bladder Stones**: Incomplete emptying of the bladder can lead to the formation of bladder stones, which can cause irritation, infection, and further blockage.

4. **Bladder Damage**: The bladder can become stretched and weakened due to the constant need to push urine past the obstruction, leading to decreased bladder function.

5. **Kidney Damage**: Increased bladder pressure can harm the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney damage or failure.

6. **Hematuria**: Blood in the urine can occur due to the increased pressure and damage to the bladder and urethra.

7. **Quality of Life**: Symptoms like frequent urination, nocturia (night-time urination), urgency, and weak urinary stream can significantly impact daily life and sleep quality.

It’s important for men experiencing symptoms of BPH to seek medical evaluation to manage the condition and mitigate these risks.","The risks associated with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) can include a variety of complications that arise from the enlargement itself and its impact on urinary function. Here are some of the primary risks:

1. **Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)**: BPE can cause LUTS, which includes symptoms related to storage of urine (frequency, urgency, nocturia) and voiding or emptying (weak stream, straining, incomplete emptying)【9:0†AUA Guidelines】.

2. **Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO)**: The enlarged prostate gland may cause obstruction at the bladder neck, referred to as benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). This can lead to difficulty in urination and other urinary symptoms【9:0†AUA Guidelines】.

3. **Acute Urinary Retention (AUR)**: BPE increases the risk of AUR, a condition where the patient is suddenly unable to urinate. This often requires emergency medical intervention and can be a significant burden for patients【9:1†AUA Guidelines】【9:2†AUA Guidelines】.

4. **Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**: Obstruction of urine flow can lead to incomplete bladder emptying, which increases the risk of recurrent UTIs【9:3†AUA Guidelines】.

5. **Bladder Stones**: Incomplete bladder emptying and urinary stasis due to BPE can contribute to the formation of bladder stones【9:17†AUA Guidelines】.

6. **Chronic Kidney Disease**: Long-term obstruction of urine flow can lead to renal insufficiency and chronic kidney disease, which is a serious complication that can affect overall health【9:17†AUA Guidelines】.

7. **Hematuria**: Gross hematuria (visible blood in the urine) can occur due to the increased vascularity and friability of the enlarged prostate tissue【9:17†AUA Guidelines】.

8. **Sexual Dysfunction**: Treatments for BPE, especially surgical interventions, can have side effects that include sexual dysfunction such as erectile dysfunction (ED) and ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD)【9:18†AUA Guidelines】.

These risks highlight the importance of proper management and treatment of BPE to mitigate these complications and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. 

For more detailed information, refer to the AUA Guidelines and other relevant guidelines【9:0†AUA Guidelines】【9:1†AUA Guidelines】【9:2†AUA Guidelines】【9:3†AUA Guidelines】【9:17†AUA Guidelines】【9:18†AUA Guidelines】.","Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), often referred to as an enlarged prostate, can lead to several risks and complications, especially if left untreated. Here are some of the main risks:

### Urinary Problems
- **Acute Urinary Retention (AUR)**: This is a sudden and painful inability to urinate, which requires immediate medical attention.
- **Chronic Urinary Retention**: This is a non-painful condition where the bladder does not empty completely, leading to potential bladder damage over time.
- **Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO)**: Increased pressure in the bladder due to obstruction can reduce urine flow and cause discomfort.

### Bladder Issues
- **Bladder Stones**: These can form due to incomplete bladder emptying.
- **Bladder Damage**: Over time, the bladder can become stretched and weakened, making it harder to contract properly.

### Kidney Damage
- **Hydronephrosis**: This is swelling of a kidney due to a build-up of urine, which can occur if the bladder is unable to empty properly.
- **Kidney Infections**: Recurrent urinary tract infections can spread to the kidneys, leading to more serious health issues.

### Increased Risk of Surgery
Men with larger prostates and more severe symptoms may face a higher likelihood of needing surgical intervention to relieve symptoms and prevent further complications.

### Quality of Life
- **Sexual Dysfunction**: Treatments for BPH, like certain medications, can cause sexual side effects such as erectile dysfunction or decreased libido.
- **Impact on Daily Activities**: Frequent urination, especially at night (nocturia), can significantly affect sleep and daily activities.

### Other Health Risks
- **Cardiac Events**: Men with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may have an increased risk of major adverse cardiac events.

### Recommendations
It's important to discuss these risks with a healthcare provider to determine the best management plan for BPH, which may include lifestyle changes, medications, or surgery depending on the severity of the condition and the patient's overall health.

### Comparison of Guidelines
- **American Urological Association (AUA)**: Emphasizes informing patients about the risks of sexual side effects with certain medications.
- **European Association of Urology (EAU)**: Highlights the dynamic progression of LUTS and the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors like metabolic syndrome to prevent complications.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to understand the best approach for managing BPH based on individual health needs and risks."
How would you classify the International Prostate Symptom Score?,No information available,Total score: 0–7 mildly symptomatic; 8–19 moderately symptomatic; 20-35 severely symptomatic.,"The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is a widely used tool to assess the severity of symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The IPSS questionnaire consists of seven questions related to urinary symptoms and one question related to the patient’s quality of life. Each of the seven symptom questions is scored from 0 to 5, with a total score ranging from 0 to 35. The IPSS can be classified into three severity categories:

Mild Symptoms: 0-7 points
Moderate Symptoms: 8-19 points
Severe Symptoms: 20-35 points
Breakdown of the IPSS Questions
Symptom Questions (Scored 0 to 5 each):

Incomplete emptying: How often have you had a sensation of not emptying your bladder completely after you finished urinating?
Frequency: How often have you had to urinate again less than two hours after you finished urinating?
Intermittency: How often have you found you stopped and started again several times when you urinated?
Urgency: How often have you found it difficult to postpone urination?
Weak stream: How often have you had a weak urinary stream?
Straining: How often have you had to push or strain to begin urination?
Nocturia: How many times do you typically get up at night to urinate?
Quality of Life Question (Scored 0 to 6):

If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that?
Interpretation of Scores
Mild Symptoms (0-7): Symptoms are usually manageable and may not significantly affect daily life.
Moderate Symptoms (8-19): Symptoms are more noticeable and may begin to impact daily activities and quality of life.
Severe Symptoms (20-35): Symptoms are highly bothersome, often significantly affecting daily activities and overall quality of life.
The IPSS is a valuable tool in both diagnosing BPH and tracking the effectiveness of treatment over time. It helps healthcare providers to determine the appropriate management strategy for patients based on the severity of their symptoms.","The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is an eight-item questionnaire designed to assess the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men. The questionnaire includes seven symptom questions and one quality of life (QoL) question. The IPSS score is categorized into four levels based on the total score:

Asymptomatic: 0 points
Mildly symptomatic: 1-7 points
Moderately symptomatic: 8-19 points
Severely symptomatic: 20-35 points
However, the IPSS has limitations, including the lack of assessment for incontinence, post-micturition symptoms, and the bother caused by each separate symptom​​.","The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) helps to classify the severity of symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Here's how the scores are categorized:

- Asymptomatic: 0 points
- Mildly Symptomatic: 1-7 points
- Moderately Symptomatic: 8-19 points
- Severely Symptomatic: 20-35 points
This scoring system is based on responses to seven questions about urinary symptoms and one question about quality of life. However, it has some limitations, such as not assessing incontinence, post-micturition symptoms, or the bother caused by each separate symptom.

What tests are available for benign prostatic enlargement?,No information available,"These tests are done to measure how well you release urine . This shows the doctor if the urethra is blocked or obstructed . There are several types:

• Urinalysis tests your urine sample to check for important things such as blood, signs of infection, glucose (sugar), protein and other factors that can tell your urologist the cause of your symptoms. Urine tests are also used to screen for bladder cancer. If you have blood in your urine, pain or burning when you pass urine, or you cannot pass urine, it is important to see your doctor right away.

• Post-void residual volume (PVR) measures urine left in the bladder after passing urine. This is done to diagnose the problem . It may also be done before surgery.

• Uroflowmetry measures how fast urine flows. This is done to diagnose the problem. It may also be done before surgery.

• Urodynamic pressure flow study tests pressure in the bladder during urination.

These tests are done to see the size and shape of the prostate . Some BPH scans include:
• Ultrasounds look inside the body and see the size and shape of the prostate.

• Cystoscopy is an exam used to look at the urethra or bladder with a scope.

• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are more detailed scans. These are done if surgery is necessary to reopen the flow of urine. These scans provide a very clear image of the prostate and surrounding area . It shows exactly how and where the prostate is enlarged.

Blood Tests
If cancer is suspected, blood tests may be done.
• Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests are used to screen for prostate cancer. The PSA blood test checks the level of PSA, a protein made only by the prostate gland. This blood test can be done in a lab, hospital or a provider's office. Avoid sexual activity several days prior to the test, as this may artificially increase the PSA reading. When the prostate is healthy, very little PSA is found in the blood. A rapid rise in PSA may be a sign that something is wrong. A benign (non-cancer) enlargement of the prostate can cause a rise in PSA levels, as can inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). The most serious cause of a rise in PSA is cancer.","For diagnosing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), various tests and assessments are used to evaluate the condition and its severity. Here are the commonly available tests:

1. **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE):**
   - The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the prostate gland and check for enlargement.

2. **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test:**
   - A blood test measuring the level of PSA, a protein produced by the prostate. Elevated levels may indicate BPH, prostate cancer, or inflammation.

3. **Urinalysis:**
   - A test of the urine to check for signs of infection, blood, or other abnormalities.

4. **Urinary Flow Test:**
   - Measures the strength and amount of urine flow, helping to determine the severity of BPH.

5. **Postvoid Residual Volume Test:**
   - Measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination using ultrasound or a catheter. 

6. **Urodynamic Tests:**
   - Assess bladder function and urine flow, helping to understand the pressure in the bladder and how it stores and releases urine.

7. **Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS):**
   - An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum to provide images of the prostate and help measure its size.

8. **Cystoscopy:**
   - A thin, flexible tube with a light and camera (cystoscope) is inserted through the urethra to examine the bladder and prostate.

9. **Prostate Biopsy:**
   - In some cases, a small sample of prostate tissue is taken for analysis to rule out prostate cancer.

10. **Imaging Tests:**
    - MRI or CT scans may be used to get detailed images of the prostate and surrounding tissues.

These tests help in diagnosing BPH, assessing its severity, and ruling out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.","The diagnostic tests available for benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) include mandatory, recommended, optional, and not recommended evaluations. These are based on clinical guidelines from the Canadian Urological Association (CUA), American Urological Association (AUA), and European Association of Urology (EAU).

### Mandatory Tests
1. **Medical History and Physical Examination**
   - History: Includes relevant prior and current illnesses, prior surgery, trauma, and current medications, including over-the-counter and phytotherapeutic agents.
   - Physical Examination: A focused physical exam, including a digital rectal examination (DRE) to assess the prostate.
   - Urinalysis: Required to rule out diagnoses other than BPH that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)   .

### Recommended Tests
1. **Symptom Inventory**
   - Use of formal symptom inventories such as the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) or AUA Symptom Index (AUA-SI) to objectively assess symptoms at initial consultation and follow-up  .
   
2. **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Testing**
   - PSA testing should be offered to patients with at least a 10-year life expectancy for whom knowledge of prostate cancer presence or changes in voiding symptoms may alter management. PSA can be a useful surrogate marker for prostate size and predict BPH progression  .

### Optional Tests
1. **Serum Creatinine**
2. **Urine Cytology**
3. **Uroflowmetry**
4. **Postvoid Residual (PVR) Measurement**
   - PVR helps assess bladder emptying and can indicate the need for further workup or intervention .
5. **Voiding Diary**
   - Particularly recommended for men with suspected nocturnal polyuria .
6. **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Screening**
7. **Sexual Function Questionnaire** .

### Not Recommended (Routine Initial Evaluation)
1. **Cytology**
2. **Cystoscopy**
3. **Urodynamics**
4. **Radiological Evaluation of Upper Urinary Tract**
5. **Prostate Ultrasound**
6. **Prostate Biopsy**
   - These tests are not recommended for routine initial evaluation but may be required for patients with specific indications such as hematuria, diagnostic uncertainty, DRE abnormalities, poor response to medical therapy, or for surgical planning  .

### Additional Considerations for Surgery
- Preoperative testing may include cystoscopy and ultrasound (either transrectal or transabdominal) to determine prostate size and the extent of the median lobe, important for selecting the appropriate surgical modality .

These tests and evaluations help in diagnosing, monitoring, and planning treatment for patients with benign prostatic enlargement.","When diagnosing benign prostatic enlargement (BPH), several tests can be used to evaluate your condition. Here are the main tests:

## Mandatory Tests
1. **Medical History and Physical Examination**: This involves discussing your symptoms, past medical history, and a physical examination, including a digital rectal exam (DRE) to check the prostate.
2. **Urinalysis**: A test of your urine to rule out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms, like infections or diabetes.
3. **International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)**: A questionnaire that helps assess the severity of your symptoms.

## Recommended Tests
1. **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Testing**: This blood test can help evaluate prostate size and the risk of prostate cancer.
2. **Post-Void Residual (PVR) Measurement**: This test measures how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate, which can indicate how well your bladder is emptying.

## Optional Tests
1. **Uroflowmetry**: A test that measures the flow rate of your urine to see if there is an obstruction.
2. **Voiding Diary**: Keeping a record of your urination patterns, including times and amounts, which can help identify issues like nocturnal polyuria (excessive urination at night).
3. **Bladder Diary**: Similar to a voiding diary, but also includes fluid intake and activities.
4. **Serum Creatinine**: A blood test to check kidney function.
5. **Imaging Tests**: Ultrasound or MRI to assess the size and shape of the prostate.

## Not Recommended Unless Necessary
- **Cystoscopy**: A procedure to look inside the bladder.
- **Urodynamics**: Tests that measure the pressure in your bladder and the flow of urine.
- **Prostate Biopsy**: Taking a tissue sample from the prostate, usually only if there's a suspicion of cancer.

## Comparison of Guidelines
- **AUA (American Urological Association)**: Emphasizes a thorough initial evaluation including medical history, physical exam, IPSS, and urinalysis. Optional tests like PVR and uroflowmetry are also mentioned.
- **CUA (Canadian Urological Association)**: Similar to AUA but includes a detailed algorithm for when to use additional tests like PSA and imaging based on symptom severity.
- **EAU (European Association of Urology)**: Recommends a comprehensive approach with bladder diaries and emphasizes the use of PSA for predicting prostate volume and risk of complications.

These tests help doctors understand your condition better and decide on the best treatment plan for you. Always discuss with your healthcare provider which tests are most appropriate for your specific situation."
Can the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) be affected by benign prostatic enlargement?,"A protein produced by the prostate which may increase in men with a benign prostatic enlargement, prostatic inflammation, or prostate cancer.","Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests are used to screen for prostate cancer. The PSA blood test checks the level of PSA, a protein made only by the prostate gland. This blood test can be done in a lab, hospital or a provider's office.

A rapid rise in PSA may be a sign that something is wrong. A benign (non-cancer) enlargement of the prostate can cause a rise in PSA levels, as can inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). The most serious cause of a rise in PSA is cancer.","Yes, benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), can affect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. PSA is a protein produced by both normal and abnormal prostate cells, and its levels can be elevated in various prostate conditions, including BPH. Here’s how BPH can influence PSA levels:

1. **Increased Prostate Volume**: BPH leads to an increase in the size of the prostate gland. A larger prostate can produce more PSA, resulting in higher levels in the blood.

2. **Inflammation and Irritation**: BPH can cause inflammation or irritation of the prostate gland, which may also lead to elevated PSA levels.

3. **Obstruction and Urinary Symptoms**: BPH can cause urinary symptoms such as difficulty in urination, increased frequency, and urgency. The physical manipulation of the prostate during these episodes or through medical examinations can temporarily raise PSA levels.

It's important to note that while elevated PSA levels can indicate the presence of BPH, they are not specific to it. Elevated PSA levels can also be seen in prostate cancer, prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate), and other prostate conditions. Therefore, if PSA levels are elevated, further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the underlying cause. This may include a digital rectal exam (DRE), imaging studies, or a prostate biopsy if cancer is suspected.","Yes, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can be affected by benign prostatic enlargement. According to the Canadian Urological Association (CUA) guidelines, serum PSA may be a useful surrogate marker of prostate size and may predict the risk of BPH progression in patients without prostate cancer. Elevated PSA levels can indicate an increase in prostate volume, which is common in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)【6†source】.

Similarly, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines state that PSA can be used to estimate prostate volume and predict future growth, aiding in the management of voiding symptoms due to BPH【6†source】. 

The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines also mention that PSA levels correlate with prostate volume and are valuable in assessing the risk of progression in BPH【6†source】.","Yes, benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) can affect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Here are the key points:

- **PSA as a Marker**: PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated PSA levels can indicate an enlarged prostate, among other conditions.
- **Prediction of Prostate Volume**: PSA is a good predictor of prostate volume. Higher PSA levels often correlate with larger prostate sizes.
- **Risk of Progression**: Elevated PSA levels can also predict the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and the need for surgery related to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO).
- **Age-Specific PSA Levels**: The acceptable PSA threshold varies by age. For example, a PSA level higher than 1.6 ng/mL in men in their 50s can indicate a prostate volume greater than 40 mL.

### Comparison of Guidelines
- **Canadian Urological Association (CUA)**: Recommends PSA testing if it will change management, noting that PSA can estimate prostate volume and predict BPH progression.
- **European Association of Urology (EAU)**: Emphasizes PSA as a strong predictor of prostate growth, AUR, and BPO-related surgery. It provides age-specific PSA thresholds for predicting prostate volume.
- **American Urological Association (AUA)**: Suggests using PSA as a surrogate for prostate size and emphasizes its role in deciding treatment options, particularly for 5-ARI therapy.

In summary, elevated PSA levels can be a sign of benign prostatic enlargement and help guide treatment decisions. Always consult with your healthcare provider to understand what your PSA levels mean for your specific situation."

What is watchful waiting in benign prostatic enlargement?,"You may wish to consider ‘watchful waiting’ if your symptoms are mild to moderate and they aren’t bothersome enough to noticeably affect your quality of life.

A watchful waiting programme involves:

Assessment of your symptoms during a consultation appointment with a doctor
A physical examination
Blood and urine tests
Education and advice about your condition
Ongoing support with managing your BPE
During watchful waiting, mild to moderate BPE symptoms can often be treated with lifestyle changes such as:

Drinking at least 1 litre of fluid every day.
Drinking less fluid before going to bed or before long trips to reduce the need to urinate during these times.
Drinking less alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks and artificial sweeteners, which can irritate the bladder and make your symptoms worse.
Taking regular exercise (at least 2-3 times a week). Lack of movement can make it more difficult to urinate.
Having a balanced and varied diet.
Keeping your lower abdomen warm and dry. Cold and damp increases the urge to urinate.
If your urine sprays when you go to the toilet, it can be helpful to sit down to urinate instead of standing or if you prefer to stand, to urinate into a cup and pour that into the toilet.
Discuss with your doctor, all medication you are taking for any condition as some medicines, such as ‘water tablets’ (called diuretics), may cause urinary symptoms to worsen.
You will be offered regular check-ups as part of watchful waiting, to make sure that your condition has not got any worse, or more troublesome to you. If it has, your doctor can discuss treatment options that are available to you.","Often, BPH may only require active surveillance. This means your BPH will be closely watched but not actively treated and may be monitored with regular visits to your urologist. A yearly exam is common. Your health care provider will look for worse or new issues before suggesting anything else. Active surveillance is best for men with mild to moderate symptoms. It is also an option for men who are not bothered by the effects of BPH.","Watchful waiting is a management strategy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) where patients with mild symptoms and minimal discomfort are monitored over time without immediate active treatment. This approach is appropriate for men who have mild symptoms that are not significantly affecting their quality of life. 

Key aspects of watchful waiting include:

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Patients have regular check-ups to monitor the progression of symptoms and any changes in the condition.
2. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Patients are often advised to make lifestyle changes that can help manage symptoms, such as reducing fluid intake before bedtime, limiting caffeine and alcohol, and practicing bladder training exercises.
3. **Symptom Tracking**: Keeping a symptom diary to track the severity and frequency of urinary symptoms.
4. **Education**: Patients are educated about the condition, potential symptoms to watch for, and when to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen.

Watchful waiting is chosen to avoid the risks and side effects associated with medications or surgical treatments, especially when symptoms are not severe. If symptoms worsen or begin to interfere with daily activities, more active treatments, such as medications or surgery, may be considered.","Watchful waiting is a conservative management approach for men with benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) who have mild to moderate symptoms that are not bothersome enough to require immediate drug treatment or surgery. This strategy involves regular monitoring of the patient's condition without active intervention unless symptoms progress or complications arise. Key components of watchful waiting include:

1. **Symptom Monitoring**: Regularly assessing the severity and impact of symptoms using tools like the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and patient questionnaires to determine the progression of symptoms and the patient's quality of life.

2. **Patient Education**: Providing information about BPE, reassuring patients that their condition is not cancerous, and explaining the potential for symptom progression and the importance of monitoring.

3. **Lifestyle and Behavioral Modifications**: Advising on changes that can help manage symptoms, such as reducing fluid intake at specific times, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, using voiding techniques, and managing constipation.

4. **Periodic Check-ups**: Regular visits to the physician to monitor urinary function, check post-void residual (PVR) volume, and reassess symptom severity to determine if intervention is needed.

Watchful waiting has been shown to be a safe option for many men, with studies indicating that a significant proportion of men remain stable over time without needing further treatment. For example, one study found that approximately 85% of men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were stable on watchful waiting after one year【9:19†source】【9:10†source】【9:14†source】.","Watchful waiting is a way to manage benign prostatic enlargement (BPH) without starting immediate medical or surgical treatment. It's suitable for men with mild to moderate symptoms who are not too bothered by their condition.

### What It Involves
- **Regular Check-ups**: You will have periodic visits with your doctor to monitor your symptoms and check for any changes.
- **Symptom Tracking**: Your doctor might use questionnaires like the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to understand how your symptoms are affecting you.
- **Objective Tests**: Tests like uroflowmetry (to measure urine flow) and post-void residual (PVR) volume (to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate) may be done.

### Lifestyle Changes
During watchful waiting, you might be advised to make some lifestyle changes to help manage your symptoms:
- **Fluid Management**: Reduce fluid intake, especially before bedtime.
- **Diet Adjustments**: Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods.
- **Medication Review**: Avoid certain medications like diuretics and decongestants that can make symptoms worse.
- **Bladder Training**: Practice techniques like timed voiding to help control your bladder.

### Follow-Up Schedule
- **Initial Review**: Usually, your first follow-up is around six months after starting watchful waiting.
- **Annual Check-ups**: After the initial review, you will typically have annual check-ups to ensure your symptoms aren't worsening.

### Effectiveness
- **Stability**: Many men remain stable on watchful waiting for several years. Studies show that about 79-85% of men stay stable over periods ranging from 17 months to five years.
- **Surgery Consideration**: Some men might eventually need surgery if their symptoms worsen. About 36% of men on watchful waiting may require surgery within five years.

### Comparison of Guidelines
- **Canadian Urological Association (CUA)**: Emphasizes periodic monitoring with both subjective (questionnaires) and objective (tests) assessments.
- **European Association of Urology (EAU)**: Recommends watchful waiting for men with mild-to-moderate symptoms and includes lifestyle advice and self-care information.
- **American Urological Association (AUA)**: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents but generally aligns with similar conservative management approaches.

By following a watchful waiting approach, you can manage your symptoms while delaying or avoiding more invasive treatments. Always discuss with your doctor to determine the best plan for your specific situation."
What is the efficacy of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (α1-blockers) for benign prostatic enlargement treatment?,No information available,No information available,"Alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (α1-blockers) are a commonly used treatment for benign prostatic enlargement (BPH). These medications work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, which helps to improve urine flow and reduce symptoms of BPH. 

### Efficacy of α1-blockers:

1. **Symptom Relief**: 
   - α1-blockers are effective in providing relief from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with BPH. Patients often experience a reduction in symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, nocturia (nighttime urination), and weak urinary stream.
   - Studies have shown that α1-blockers can significantly improve the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), a commonly used tool to assess the severity of BPH symptoms.

2. **Improvement in Urine Flow**:
   - These medications can lead to a moderate increase in maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), which is a key measure of the efficacy of BPH treatments.
   - The improvement in Qmax is typically in the range of 1-3 mL/s, which, although modest, can result in significant symptom relief for patients.

3. **Onset of Action**:
   - One of the advantages of α1-blockers is their relatively quick onset of action. Patients may begin to notice symptom improvement within a few days to a week of starting treatment.

4. **Long-term Efficacy**:
   - α1-blockers have been shown to maintain their efficacy over the long term, with studies demonstrating continued symptom relief and improved urine flow for several years in patients who remain on therapy.

### Common α1-blockers Used:

- **Tamsulosin**: Selective for the α1A-adrenoceptor, leading to fewer cardiovascular side effects.
- **Alfuzosin**: Non-selective but has a relatively favorable side effect profile.
- **Terazosin and Doxazosin**: Non-selective and may require dose titration to minimize side effects.

### Side Effects:

While α1-blockers are generally well-tolerated, they can have side effects, including:

- **Dizziness and Postural Hypotension**: Due to their blood pressure-lowering effects, particularly with non-selective α1-blockers.
- **Retrograde Ejaculation**: More common with tamsulosin.
- **Rhinitis and Nasal Congestion**: Can occur with some α1-blockers.

### Comparison with Other Treatments:

- α1-blockers are often compared with 5α-reductase inhibitors, another class of BPH medications. While 5α-reductase inhibitors work by reducing the size of the prostate, they take longer to show effects and are typically more effective in patients with larger prostates. 
- Combination therapy with α1-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors is sometimes used for patients with more severe symptoms or larger prostates, offering the benefits of both classes.

In summary, α1-blockers are a first-line treatment for BPH, providing effective and relatively rapid symptom relief with a favorable safety profile. Their efficacy in improving urinary symptoms and flow rates makes them a cornerstone in the management of BPH.","Alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (α1-blockers) are commonly used to treat benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) and are considered effective for relieving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The efficacy of these medications is well-documented across several guidelines:

1. **Clinical Efficacy**: 
   - α1-blockers generally show similar clinical efficacy across different formulations, with substantial improvement in symptoms observed typically within weeks, but significant efficacy over placebo can occur within hours to days【9:12†EAU Guidelines】.
   - Studies have shown that α1-blockers can reduce the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) by approximately 30-40% and increase the maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) by approximately 20-25%【9:12†EAU Guidelines】【9:18†AUA Guidelines】.

2. **Symptom Relief**: 
   - α1-blockers are effective in reducing both storage and voiding LUTS. They are recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for men with symptomatic bother due to BPH【9:19†CUA Guidelines】.
   - Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin, doxazosin, and terazosin have all been found to be equally effective in improving LUTS, though the choice of agent may depend on patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and adverse event profiles【9:19†CUA Guidelines】.

3. **Patient Response and Recommendations**: 
   - Due to the similar efficacy of α1-blockers, switching between different α1-blockers if patients fail to improve on the initial medication is generally not recommended. Instead, alternative treatment strategies should be considered if there is no sufficient improvement with the first drug【9:18†AUA Guidelines】.
   - When prescribing an α1-blocker, the choice should be based on patient age, comorbidities, and different adverse event profiles, such as the risk of ejaculatory dysfunction or changes in blood pressure【9:18†AUA Guidelines】.

Overall, α1-blockers are highly effective for the management of LUTS due to BPE/BPH, providing significant symptom relief and improving urinary flow rates in most patients. The choice among the available α1-blockers should consider individual patient characteristics and potential side effects.","Alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, commonly known as α1-blockers, are widely used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Here’s a summary of their efficacy:

## Efficacy of α1-Blockers

### Improvement in Symptoms
- **Symptom Relief**: α1-blockers are effective in reducing urinary symptoms. They typically reduce the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) by approximately 5-8 points, which is a significant improvement compared to placebo.
- **Onset of Action**: Clinical effects can start within hours to days, though full benefits may take a few weeks to develop.

### Improvement in Urinary Flow
- **Peak Urinary Flow Rate (Qmax)**: α1-blockers increase the peak urinary flow rate by about 20-25%, which helps in easing the passage of urine.

### Quality of Life
- **Quality of Life**: Patients generally experience a significant improvement in their quality of life due to the reduction in urinary symptoms.

### Long-Term Efficacy
- **Sustained Benefits**: Improvements in symptoms and urinary flow are maintained over at least four years of treatment. However, α1-blockers do not reduce prostate size or prevent acute urinary retention (AUR) in the long term.

## Safety and Side Effects
- **Common Side Effects**: The most frequent adverse effects include dizziness, orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure when standing up), and ejaculatory disturbances.
- **Specific Risks**: Some α1-blockers, particularly tamsulosin, are associated with a condition called intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) during cataract surgery. Patients should inform their ophthalmologist if they are taking these medications.

## Summary of Guidelines
### Canadian Urological Association (CUA)
- **Recommendation**: Strong recommendation for α1-blockers as a first-line treatment for men with symptomatic bother due to BPH.
- **Effectiveness**: All five agents (alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, silodosin) appear to have equal clinical effectiveness.

### American Urological Association (AUA)
- **Recommendation**: Moderate recommendation for α1-blockers for patients with bothersome, moderate to severe LUTS/BPH.
- **Effectiveness**: Similar efficacy across all α1-blockers with no particular subset of patients more suited for one over another.

### European Association of Urology (EAU)
- **Recommendation**: Strong recommendation to offer α1-blockers to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS.
- **Effectiveness**: α1-blockers reduce IPSS by 30-40% and increase Qmax by 20-25%.

In conclusion, α1-blockers are highly effective in improving urinary symptoms and quality of life for men with BPH. They work quickly and maintain their benefits over the long term, although they do not reduce prostate size or prevent urinary retention. Patients should be aware of potential side effects and discuss any planned surgeries with their doctors."
What are the most common side effects of plant extracts/phytotherapy for benign prostatic enlargement treatment?,Side effects of herbal drugs are mild and many men do not experience any side effects at all. Gastro-intestinal discomfort (for instance bloating or constipation) is the most common complaint.,No information available,"Phytotherapy, the use of plant extracts for therapeutic purposes, is commonly used to manage benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Some of the most common plant extracts used include saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, pygeum, and rye grass pollen extract. While generally considered safe, these treatments can have side effects. The most common side effects include:

1. **Saw Palmetto:**
   - Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, constipation)
   - Dizziness
   - Headache
   - Decreased libido

2. **Beta-Sitosterol:**

   - Impotence
   - Erection problems

3. **Pygeum:**
   - Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, constipation)
   - Stomach pain
   - Headache

4. **Rye Grass Pollen Extract:**
   - Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, diarrhea)
   - Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, breathing difficulties)
   - Dizziness

It is important for patients to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any phytotherapy, as these treatments can interact with other medications and underlying health conditions. Regular monitoring and reporting any side effects to a healthcare provider are also recommended.","The most common side effects of plant extracts or phytotherapy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are generally mild but can vary depending on the specific plant extract used. Here are the notable side effects from some commonly used plant extracts:

1. **Serenoa repens (Saw Palmetto)**:
   - Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
   - Mild headache.
   - Occasional erectile dysfunction or decreased libido【9:18†source】【9:19†source】.

2. **Pygeum africanum**:
   - Gastrointestinal issues like nausea and abdominal pain.
   - Allergic reactions, though rare【9:16†source】.

3. **Urtica dioica (Stinging Nettle)**:
   - Mild gastrointestinal symptoms.
   - Rarely, allergic reactions【9:16†source】.

4. **Epilobium species**:
   - Mild gastrointestinal discomfort.
   - Rare allergic reactions【9:10†source】.

5. **Cucurbita pepo (Pumpkin Seed)**:
   - Mild gastrointestinal symptoms.
   - Generally considered safe with no severe side effects reported【9:16†source】.

Overall, these side effects are typically mild and infrequent, making phytotherapy a generally safe option for managing BPH symptoms. However, patients should always consult with their healthcare provider before starting any new treatment to ensure it is appropriate for their specific health conditions.","The most common side effects of using plant extracts, specifically hexane extracted Serenoa repens (HESr), for treating benign prostatic enlargement are gastrointestinal disorders. This can include symptoms like stomach upset or discomfort.

It's also important to note that HESr has a very limited negative impact on sexual function, making it a suitable option for men who want to avoid side effects related to sexual health. However, the overall effectiveness of these treatments may be modest, so it's important to have realistic expectations regarding symptom improvement."
What are the indications for combining oral therapies to treat benign prostatic enlargement?,"The combination of alpha-blockers with 5ARIs is recommended if:

your prostate is larger than 40 mL;
your prostate-specific antigen level is 1.5 ng/mL or higher;
your symptoms are severe, and you have slow flow of urine.
This combination of drugs is only advised for long-term treatment.

The combination of alpha-blockers and MRAs or beta-3 agonists is recommended if you have symptoms such as an increased or sudden need to urinate and your symptoms have not improved when taking one type of drug.",No information available,"Combining oral therapies to treat benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is often indicated in several clinical scenarios to provide better symptom relief and target different aspects of the condition. Here are the primary indications:

1. **Moderate to Severe Symptoms**: Men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) often benefit from combination therapy. This approach helps improve both storage and voiding symptoms more effectively than monotherapy.

2. **Prostate Size**: Men with larger prostates (typically greater than 30-40 grams) are more likely to benefit from combination therapy. The combination can help reduce the risk of progression and need for surgery.

3. **Incomplete Response to Monotherapy**: If a patient does not achieve sufficient symptom relief with a single medication, adding another drug can provide additional benefits. For instance, if an alpha-blocker alone does not sufficiently relieve symptoms, adding a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor can enhance treatment efficacy.

4. **Risk of Disease Progression**: Patients at higher risk of BPH progression (e.g., older age, larger prostate volume, higher prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels) may benefit from combination therapy to prevent further complications such as acute urinary retention or the need for surgical intervention.

5. **Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)**: Different classes of medications target different symptoms. For instance, alpha-blockers primarily alleviate obstructive symptoms (e.g., weak stream, difficulty starting urination), while 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors reduce prostate size and improve long-term symptoms. Antimuscarinics can be added if overactive bladder symptoms (e.g., urgency, frequency) are prominent.

### Common Combination Therapies

1. **Alpha-Blockers and 5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors**: This is the most common combination. Alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin, alfuzosin) provide quick symptom relief, while 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) reduce prostate size over time.

2. **Alpha-Blockers and Antimuscarinics**: This combination is used when patients have both voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) symptoms. Antimuscarinics (e.g., tolterodine, oxybutynin) help alleviate bladder overactivity symptoms.

3. **Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE5i) and Alpha-Blockers**: PDE5 inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil) can be combined with alpha-blockers for men who have both BPH and erectile dysfunction.

### Monitoring and Adjustments

Patients on combination therapy need regular follow-up to monitor for side effects, effectiveness, and any potential drug interactions. Adjustments to the treatment regimen may be necessary based on symptom progression and patient response.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan tailored to the individual's specific clinical scenario.","The indications for combining oral therapies to treat benign prostatic enlargement are detailed in the guidelines from AUA, EAU, and CUA. Here are the key points:

### Combination of 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors (5-ARI) and Alpha Blockers
- **Indications**: This combination is recommended for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with demonstrable prostatic enlargement. Indicators include:
  - Prostate volume >30g on imaging
  - Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >1.5ng/mL
  - Palpable prostate enlargement on digital rectal examination (DRE)【9:1†source】【9:3†source】 .

### Combination with Anticholinergics
- **Indications**: Anticholinergic agents, either alone or in combination with an alpha blocker, may be offered to patients with moderate to severe predominant storage LUTS. This combination can help manage storage symptoms such as urgency and frequency【9:1†source】【9:19†source】 .

### Combination with Beta-3 Agonists
- **Indications**: Beta-3 agonists in combination with an alpha blocker may be offered to patients with moderate to severe predominant storage LUTS. This combination is suggested to improve symptoms without significantly increasing the risk of urinary retention【9:1†source】  .

### Combination with Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE5)
- **Indications**: Clinicians may offer the combination of low-dose daily tadalafil with alpha blockers for the treatment of LUTS/BPH, especially in patients who also have erectile dysfunction (ED). This combination is conditionally recommended based on evolving data【9:1†source】【9:14†source】 .

### Specific Considerations
- **Efficacy**: Long-term data (four years) from studies like MTOPS and CombAT show that combination therapy is superior to monotherapy in terms of symptom improvement and reduction in the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and need for surgery .
- **Side Effects**: Combination therapies may have higher rates of adverse events, such as ejaculatory disturbances when using 5-ARIs and alpha-blockers. However, the benefits in reducing progression and improving symptoms often outweigh these risks【9:1†source】 .

These indications highlight the strategic use of combination therapy in managing BPH to improve patient outcomes while considering the balance of benefits and potential side effects.","Combining oral therapies to treat benign prostatic enlargement (BPH) can be effective for certain patients. Here are the main indications for different combination therapies:

## α1-Blockers + 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors (5-ARIs)
- **Indications**: For men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and an enlarged prostate (prostate volume > 30g or PSA > 1.5 ng/mL).
- **Effectiveness**: This combination is superior to either medication alone for improving symptoms, reducing the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR), and decreasing the need for prostate surgery.
- **Recommendation**: Strong support from guidelines for men at risk of disease progression.

## α1-Blockers + Antimuscarinic Agents
- **Indications**: For patients with moderate to severe LUTS, particularly those with predominant storage symptoms like urgency and frequency.
- **Effectiveness**: Effective in improving storage symptoms without significantly increasing the risk of urinary retention in patients without high post-void residual (PVR) urine.
- **Recommendation**: Conditional support, especially if alpha blockers alone are not sufficient.

## α1-Blockers + Beta-3 Agonists
- **Indications**: For patients with moderate to severe LUTS, particularly those with storage symptoms that persist despite α1-blocker therapy.
- **Effectiveness**: Can improve symptoms like urinary frequency and urgency.
- **Recommendation**: Conditional support, with a focus on patients who cannot tolerate antimuscarinic agents.

## α1-Blockers + Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors (PDE5Is)
- **Indications**: For men with LUTS and erectile dysfunction.
- **Effectiveness**: Improves both urinary symptoms and erectile function.
- **Recommendation**: Conditional support, with the benefit of improving both LUTS and sexual function.

## 5-ARIs + PDE5Is
- **Indications**: For men with LUTS and an enlarged prostate, particularly those who also have erectile dysfunction.
- **Effectiveness**: Can improve urinary symptoms and erectile function.
- **Recommendation**: Conditional support, with benefits for both urinary and sexual health.

## Key Points from Guidelines
- **American Urological Association (AUA)**: Strongly supports combination of α1-blockers and 5-ARIs for men with enlarged prostates. Conditional support for combining α1-blockers with antimuscarinics, beta-3 agonists, or PDE5Is.
- **European Association of Urology (EAU)**: Similar recommendations, with strong support for α1-blockers and 5-ARIs combination. Conditional support for other combinations.
- **Canadian Urological Association (CUA)**: Strongly supports α1-blockers and 5-ARIs combination. Conditional support for combinations with antimuscarinics, beta-3 agonists, or PDE5Is.

In summary, combination therapies can be tailored to the patient's specific symptoms and prostate characteristics. Always discuss with a healthcare provider to find the best treatment plan for your needs."
What is the recurrence of benign prostatic enlargement after oral medications?,"BPE cannot be completely cured and all medical and surgical treatments that are available focus on reducing the symptoms as far as possible. BPE symptoms and how bothersome they are can change over time. You may or may not decide to have further or more invasive treatment depending on your circumstances or how much the symptoms affect your daily life.

Your doctor will help you to make informed decisions about how you decide to treat your BPE and advise you of any new treatment options available so that your BPE is as well-managed as it can be, and you are able to enjoy your relationships and participate in all aspects of your life.",No information available,"Recurrence of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) after oral medications varies based on several factors, including the type of medication, patient compliance, and individual patient characteristics. The primary oral medications used for BPE include alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs). Here's an overview of the recurrence rates and considerations:

### Alpha-Blockers:
- **Mechanism:** These medications relax the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing bladder outlet obstruction.
- **Effectiveness:** They are effective in relieving symptoms relatively quickly.
- **Recurrence:** Symptom relief is typically sustained as long as the medication is continued. However, once the medication is stopped, symptoms often recur within weeks to months.
- **Study Findings:** Some studies indicate that up to 80-90% of patients may experience symptom recurrence after discontinuing alpha-blockers.

### 5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors (5-ARIs):
- **Mechanism:** These medications reduce the size of the prostate by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is involved in prostate growth.
- **Effectiveness:** They are effective in reducing prostate size and improving symptoms, but the effects can take several months to become noticeable.
- **Recurrence:** If the medication is discontinued, prostate size and symptoms can gradually return over time.
- **Study Findings:** Long-term studies show that the recurrence rate of BPE symptoms can be lower compared to alpha-blockers, but there is still a significant risk of recurrence after stopping the medication.

### Combination Therapy:
- **Mechanism:** Combining alpha-blockers and 5-ARIs can provide both immediate symptom relief and long-term prostate size reduction.
- **Effectiveness:** This approach can be more effective in reducing the risk of symptom recurrence compared to monotherapy.
- **Recurrence:** The risk of recurrence is lower with combination therapy, but symptoms can still recur if the medications are discontinued.

### Other Considerations:
- **Patient Compliance:** Adherence to medication regimens significantly impacts recurrence rates. Non-compliance or irregular medication use increases the likelihood of recurrence.
- **Individual Variability:** Factors such as the severity of BPE, baseline prostate size, and the presence of other health conditions can influence recurrence rates.
- **Long-Term Management:** Continuous medical therapy is often necessary to maintain symptom control and prevent recurrence.

In summary, while oral medications can effectively manage BPE symptoms, there is a significant risk of recurrence if the medications are discontinued. Combination therapy may offer better long-term outcomes, but patient compliance and individual patient factors play crucial roles in the recurrence of BPE.","The recurrence of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) symptoms after oral medication treatment, such as alpha-blockers or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, can vary. Some key findings from the guidelines are:

1. **Alpha-Blockers**:
   - **Discontinuation of Alpha-Blockers**: Studies show that discontinuation of alpha-blockers after initial treatment can lead to recurrence of symptoms. For example, the combination of finasteride and doxazosin showed that discontinuing alpha-blockers led to symptom recurrence【9:8†AUA Guidelines】.
   - **Long-Term Efficacy**: Long-term use of alpha-blockers like doxazosin has shown sustained efficacy and tolerability in managing BPE symptoms over a period of four years【9:8†AUA Guidelines】.

2. **5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors**:
   - **Combination Therapy**: The combination of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (like finasteride) with alpha-blockers (like tamsulosin) has shown to be effective in reducing symptoms. However, the recurrence of symptoms can still occur if therapy is discontinued. Studies like the MTOPS research indicated that combination therapy helps in reducing the risk of clinical progression compared to monotherapy【9:1†AUA Guidelines】【9:2†CUA Guidelines】.
   - **Long-Term Improvement**: Long-term use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors alone, such as dutasteride, has shown sustained improvement in symptoms and reduced risk of acute urinary retention and need for surgery over periods up to four years【9:1†AUA Guidelines】.

3. **Recurrence After Treatment**:
   - The BPH6 study indicated that over a two-year period, patients treated with Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL) had similar rates of reoperation due to symptom recurrence compared to those treated with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Medication retreatment in either arm of the study was not specifically reported【9:15†AUA Guidelines】.
   - After stopping therapy, patients remain at increased risk for recurrent urinary retention. Thus, continued medical therapy is often recommended to manage symptoms effectively and prevent recurrence【9:19†AUA Guidelines】.

In summary, the recurrence of BPE symptoms after discontinuing oral medications is common, and ongoing therapy is generally necessary to maintain symptom relief and prevent progression.","The recurrence of benign prostatic enlargement (BPH) after treatment with oral medications can vary depending on the type of medication used and individual patient factors. Here is a summary of the main types of oral medications used for BPH and their effects:

## Alpha Blockers
- **Effectiveness**: These medications can provide significant improvement in urinary symptoms and quality of life.
- **Recurrence**: They do not reduce the size of the prostate, so symptoms can return if the medication is stopped.

## 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors (5-ARIs)
- **Effectiveness**: These medications reduce the size of the prostate and improve urinary symptoms over 6-12 months.
- **Recurrence**: They are more likely to provide longer-term relief because they address the underlying enlargement of the prostate.

## Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (PDE5s)
- **Effectiveness**: These can improve both urinary symptoms and erectile function.
- **Recurrence**: Similar to alpha blockers, they do not reduce prostate size, so symptoms may return if the medication is discontinued.

## Beta-3 Agonists and Anticholinergics
- **Effectiveness**: These are used primarily for storage symptoms like frequent urination.
- **Recurrence**: They do not affect the size of the prostate, so symptoms can recur if the medication is stopped.

### Comparison
- **Alpha Blockers and PDE5s**: Provide symptom relief but do not reduce prostate size, leading to a higher chance of symptom recurrence if treatment is stopped.
- **5-ARIs**: Reduce prostate size, offering a longer-term solution with a lower chance of recurrence.
- **Beta-3 Agonists and Anticholinergics**: Address specific symptoms but do not prevent recurrence related to prostate size.

In summary, medications like 5-ARIs that reduce the size of the prostate are more likely to provide lasting relief from symptoms, while those that do not reduce prostate size may see a return of symptoms if treatment is stopped. Always consult your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your specific situation."
Surgical,,,,,
Which surgical procedures are available for benign prostatic enlargement?,"The main procedures are:

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)
Open prostatectomy
Laser vaporisation of the prostate
Laser enucleation of the prostate
Prostatic urethral lift","The main procedures are:

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)
Open prostatectomy
Laser vaporisation of the prostate
Laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLep, Thulium)
Prostatic urethral lift","For benign prostatic enlargement, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), several surgical options are available, each suited to different degrees of enlargement and patient conditions. Here are some of the most common procedures:

1. **Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)**: This is the most common surgery for BPH and is considered the gold standard. It involves the removal of prostate tissue using a resectoscope inserted through the urethra. It’s effective for moderate to severe enlargement.

2. **Transurethral Incision of the Prostate (TUIP)**: Similar to TURP, but instead of removing prostate tissue, small cuts are made in the prostate to reduce its size and relieve pressure on the urethra. It’s typically used for smaller prostate enlargements.

3. **Open Prostatectomy**: This involves a surgical incision to remove the enlarged prostate tissue. This procedure is usually reserved for very large prostates or when other complications are present.

4. **Laser Therapy**: Various laser techniques (like Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate or GreenLight laser therapy) are used to either enucleate or vaporize obstructive prostate tissue. These methods are known for causing less blood loss and having quicker recovery times.

5. **UroLift System**: A minimally invasive procedure that places small implants to lift and hold the enlarged prostate tissue so it no longer blocks the urethra. It’s not a tissue-removing surgery and is suitable for men with smaller prostate enlargement.

6. **Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE)**: A newer, minimally invasive treatment where the blood supply to specific areas of the prostate is blocked, causing those areas to shrink. It's performed by interventional radiologists using radiographic imaging.

7. **Aquablation**: Uses a robotically controlled waterjet to remove prostate tissue under real-time ultrasound guidance, combining minimally invasive surgery with sophisticated imaging.

The choice of procedure depends on several factors including the size of the prostate, the patient’s health status, the presence of any urinary tract symptoms, and personal preferences. Each procedure carries its own risks and benefits, which should be discussed with a healthcare provider.","The available surgical procedures for benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) include several techniques classified into three main categories: minimally invasive surgical treatments (MIST), simple prostatectomy, and transurethral surgery. Here are the specific procedures:

1. **Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)**
   - **Monopolar TURP**: Classic approach using monopolar electroconductive equipment.
   - **Bipolar TURP**: Alternative to monopolar TURP with decreased perioperative bleeding and risk of TUR syndrome【9:14†AUA Guidelines.pdf】【9:4†AUA Guidelines.pdf】.

   - **GreenLight Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate (PVP)**: Minimally invasive option for patients with bleeding disorders .

3. **Open Simple Prostatectomy (OSP)**
   - Effective for very large prostates (>80 cc) and involves an open surgical approach with higher invasiveness compared to endoscopic methods【9:14†AUA Guidelines.pdf】 .

4. **Minimally Invasive Simple Prostatectomy (MISP)**
   - **Laparoscopic Simple Prostatectomy (LSP)**
   - **Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy (RASP)**: Both options are less invasive than OSP and are effective for large prostates【9:14†AUA Guidelines.pdf】 .

5. **Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL)**
   - A minimally invasive procedure suitable for patients desiring to preserve sexual function【9:14†AUA Guidelines.pdf】.

6. **Water Vapor Thermal Therapy (WVTT)**
   - Uses water vapor to ablate prostate tissue, suitable for office-based treatments【9:14†AUA Guidelines.pdf】.

7. **Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE)**
   - A minimally invasive technique performed by interventional radiologists【9:10†AUA Guidelines.pdf】.

8. **Bipolar Transurethral Enucleation of the Prostate (B-TUEP)**
   - An endoscopic method involving enucleation of the prostate tissue, followed by morcellation or resection .

9. **Plasmakinetic Enucleation of the Prostate (PKEP)**
   - Utilizes bipolar technology for enucleation and is an alternative to traditional methods like TURP 【9:10†AUA Guidelines.pdf】.

These procedures are selected based on prostate size, patient's overall health, and the surgeon's expertise, aiming to provide effective treatment with minimal complications and quick recovery【9:14†AUA Guidelines.pdf】【9:14†AUA Guidelines.pdf】 .","When it comes to treating benign prostatic enlargement (BPH), there are several surgical procedures available.

What is the recurrence of benign prostatic enlargement after transurethral resection of the prostate?,"BPE cannot be completely cured and all medical and surgical treatments that are available focus on reducing the symptoms as far as possible. BPE symptoms and how bothersome they are can change over time. You may or may not decide to have further or more invasive treatment depending on your circumstances or how much the symptoms affect your daily life.

Your doctor will help you to make informed decisions about how you decide to treat your BPE and advise you of any new treatment options available so that your BPE is as well-managed as it can be, and you are able to enjoy your relationships and participate in all aspects of your life.",No information available,"The recurrence of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) varies but is relatively low. Studies indicate that the need for re-treatment ranges between 5% and 15% within 5 to 10 years post-surgery. Recurrence can occur due to various factors such as incomplete removal of prostate tissue, regrowth of the remaining prostate tissue, or the development of new prostate issues.

Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider are essential to monitor for signs of recurrence and manage any new symptoms that may arise.","The recurrence rate of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) varies by study and duration of follow-up. The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines report that the retreatment rates after TURP are approximately 0.9% at three months, 3.7% at one year, 9.5% at five years, and 12.7% at eight years. The incidence of re-TURP specifically was reported as 0.8% at three months, 2.4% at one year, 6.1% at five years, and 8.3% at eight years【9:8†EAU Guidelines.pdf】.

According to the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines, nearly 15% of patients required a secondary procedure after eight years. Additionally, in one randomized controlled trial (RCT), the long-term need for reoperation was reported to be similar between transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) and TURP in men with small prostates (≤30g)【9:6†AUA Guidelines.pdf】【9:13†AUA Guidelines.pdf】.

These figures indicate that while TURP is an effective treatment for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, there is a considerable long-term rate of recurrence requiring retreatment.","The recurrence rate of benign prostatic enlargement after Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) can vary. Here are some key points:

## Recurrence Rates:
- **Monopolar TURP (M-TURP)**:
  - **Short-term (up to 1 year)**: The retreatment rate is about 2.6%.
  - **Mid-term (up to 3 years)**: Approximately 6.1% of patients may need another procedure.
  - **Long-term (up to 8 years)**: Around 8.3% of patients might require a repeat TURP.

- **Bipolar TURP (B-TURP)**:
  - **Short-term and Mid-term**: Similar to M-TURP with no significant difference in retreatment rates.
  - **Long-term (up to 5 years)**: The retreatment rates are comparable to those of M-TURP.

## Safety Considerations:
- **Both M-TURP and B-TURP** are generally safe, but B-TURP has a lower risk of complications like bleeding and TUR syndrome (a rare but serious condition caused by absorption of fluids during surgery).

## Comparison Across Guidelines:
- **AUA (American Urological Association)**: TURP is recommended for small to average-sized prostates (up to 80 mL), with both monopolar and bipolar options being viable.
- **EAU (European Association of Urology)**: Similar recommendations, emphasizing the lower peri-operative risks with B-TURP.
- **CUA (Canadian Urological Association)**: Also supports both M-TURP and B-TURP for prostates between 30-80 mL, highlighting the lower risk of complications with B-TURP.

In summary, TURP is an effective and commonly used procedure for treating benign prostatic enlargement, with a relatively low long-term recurrence rate. Bipolar TURP may offer a safer profile, especially concerning bleeding and TUR syndrome."

What procedural/surgical treatments are available for a 120ml prostate?,"Open prostatectomy, HoLEP, bipolar enucleation, laser vaporisation, thulium enucleation, TURP","Simple prostatectomy (Open, laparoscopic, robotic), HoLEP, ThuLEP","For a prostate gland that's around 120ml in size, the treatment options are generally geared towards more invasive surgical procedures, as this size typically results in significant symptoms or complications from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Here are the primary surgical treatments available:

1. **Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)**: This is the most common surgery for BPH and is used extensively for prostates sized between 30ml to 80-100ml. For larger prostates like 120ml, TURP can still be performed, but it may have increased risks of complications or require a staged procedure (done in two parts).

2. **Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP)**: HoLEP is effective for all sizes of prostates, including very large glands such as a 120ml prostate. It involves enucleating the prostate tissue using a laser and is known for its efficacy and lower risk of significant blood loss.

3. **Open Prostatectomy**: This is generally reserved for very large prostates over 80-100ml. Open prostatectomy involves a more invasive surgical approach where the prostate is removed through an incision in the abdomen. It's typically considered when other less invasive options are unsuitable or have failed.

4. **Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy**: Although primarily used for prostate cancer, in cases where the prostate is very large and other minimally invasive methods are not suitable, a robotic-assisted approach can be considered. This method offers the benefits of smaller incisions, potentially less pain, and faster recovery.

5. **Thulium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (ThuLEP)**: Similar to HoLEP, this technique uses a different type of laser to remove prostate tissue. It's effective for large prostates and has benefits similar to HoLEP, including reduced bleeding and the possibility of treating anticoagulated patients.

6. **Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE)**: Though less commonly used for very large prostates, PAE is a minimally invasive procedure that involves cutting off the blood supply to the prostate, causing it to shrink. This can be an option for patients who are not good candidates for surgery.

The choice among these options depends on various factors including the patient’s health status, the presence of other medical conditions, the specific symptoms experienced, and the expertise and equipment available at the treating facility.","For a prostate size of 120 ml, several procedural and surgical treatments are available:
