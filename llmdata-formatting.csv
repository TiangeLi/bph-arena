What are the symptoms of benign prostatic enlargement?,"BPE can result in a range of symptoms including:

A delay in starting and/or finishing urinating
Having to strain to urinate
A weak stream of urine
Stopping and starting while urinating
Spraying urine while going to the toilet, or the urinary stream splitting
The feeling that you cannot fully empty your bladder
Needing to urinate more often than is normal and/or more urgently
Waking up at night to urinate
Finding it difficult to hold or control your bladder
Accidentally leaking urine (urinary incontinence)
In some men, the symptoms are mild and do not need treatment. In others, they can be troublesome and can benefit from treatment.","When the prostate is enlarged, it can bother or block the bladder. Needing to pass urine often is a common symptom of BPH. This might include the need to pass urine as often as every one to two hours, mainly at night.

Other symptoms of BPH are listed below:
• Incomplete emptying: the feeling your bladder is full, even after passing urine.
• Frequency: the need to pass urine often, about every one to two hours.
• Intermittency: the need to stop and start several times when passing urine.
• Urgency: feeling the urgent need to pass urine as if you can’t wait.
• Weak stream: a weak urine flow.
• Straining: trouble starting to pass urine or the need to push or strain to pass urine.
• Nocturia: the need to wake up at night more than two times to pass urine.",no kb,kb,chatbph
What are the risks of benign prostatic enlargement? ,"BPE is not cancer. In some cases, it can lead to serious complications such as kidney disease or the inability to urinate. You should always contact your doctor if you have any difficulty urinating.",No information available,no kb,kb,chatbph

What tests are available for benign prostatic enlargement?,No information available,"These tests are done to measure how well you release urine . This shows the doctor if the urethra is blocked or obstructed . There are several types:

• Urinalysis tests your urine sample to check for important things such as blood, signs of infection, glucose (sugar), protein and other factors that can tell your urologist the cause of your symptoms. Urine tests are also used to screen for bladder cancer. If you have blood in your urine, pain or burning when you pass urine, or you cannot pass urine, it is important to see your doctor right away.

• Post-void residual volume (PVR) measures urine left in the bladder after passing urine. This is done to diagnose the problem . It may also be done before surgery.

• Uroflowmetry measures how fast urine flows. This is done to diagnose the problem. It may also be done before surgery.

• Urodynamic pressure flow study tests pressure in the bladder during urination.

These tests are done to see the size and shape of the prostate . Some BPH scans include:
• Ultrasounds look inside the body and see the size and shape of the prostate.

• Cystoscopy is an exam used to look at the urethra or bladder with a scope.

• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are more detailed scans. These are done if surgery is necessary to reopen the flow of urine. These scans provide a very clear image of the prostate and surrounding area . It shows exactly how and where the prostate is enlarged.

Blood Tests
If cancer is suspected, blood tests may be done.
• Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests are used to screen for prostate cancer. The PSA blood test checks the level of PSA, a protein made only by the prostate gland. This blood test can be done in a lab, hospital or a provider's office. Avoid sexual activity several days prior to the test, as this may artificially increase the PSA reading. When the prostate is healthy, very little PSA is found in the blood. A rapid rise in PSA may be a sign that something is wrong. A benign (non-cancer) enlargement of the prostate can cause a rise in PSA levels, as can inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). The most serious cause of a rise in PSA is cancer.",no kb,kb,chatbph

What is watchful waiting in benign prostatic enlargement?,"You may wish to consider ‘watchful waiting’ if your symptoms are mild to moderate and they aren’t bothersome enough to noticeably affect your quality of life.

A watchful waiting programme involves:

Assessment of your symptoms during a consultation appointment with a doctor
A physical examination
Blood and urine tests
Education and advice about your condition
Ongoing support with managing your BPE
During watchful waiting, mild to moderate BPE symptoms can often be treated with lifestyle changes such as:

Drinking at least 1 litre of fluid every day.
Drinking less fluid before going to bed or before long trips to reduce the need to urinate during these times.
Drinking less alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks and artificial sweeteners, which can irritate the bladder and make your symptoms worse.
Taking regular exercise (at least 2-3 times a week). Lack of movement can make it more difficult to urinate.
Having a balanced and varied diet.
Keeping your lower abdomen warm and dry. Cold and damp increases the urge to urinate.
If your urine sprays when you go to the toilet, it can be helpful to sit down to urinate instead of standing or if you prefer to stand, to urinate into a cup and pour that into the toilet.
Discuss with your doctor, all medication you are taking for any condition as some medicines, such as ‘water tablets’ (called diuretics), may cause urinary symptoms to worsen.
You will be offered regular check-ups as part of watchful waiting, to make sure that your condition has not got any worse, or more troublesome to you. If it has, your doctor can discuss treatment options that are available to you.","Often, BPH may only require active surveillance. This means your BPH will be closely watched but not actively treated and may be monitored with regular visits to your urologist. A yearly exam is common. Your health care provider will look for worse or new issues before suggesting anything else. Active surveillance is best for men with mild to moderate symptoms. It is also an option for men who are not bothered by the effects of BPH.",no kb,kb,chatbph

your symptoms are severe, and you have slow flow of urine.
This combination of drugs is only advised for long-term treatment.
